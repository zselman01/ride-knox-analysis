"""
load_warehouse.py -- build the Ride Knox warehouse from staged files.

The handoffs are real: Bash gated and staged the files; this loader is the
only code that writes trips into the database; SQL (views.sql / extracts.sql)
is the only thing the report reads from. Nothing is hand-copied between tools.

Per staged trips file:  stage (to_sql, schema-less on purpose) -> normalize
rider_type in SQL -> migrate with INSERT OR IGNORE where the PRIMARY KEY does
the identity work -- and, because SQLite's OR IGNORE silently swallows every
other violation too, the WHERE clause mirrors the FK so nothing disappears
without a name. Receipts per file; a system reconciliation ledger at the end;
the arithmetic must close, file by file, to the row.

Usage: python3 pipeline/load_warehouse.py <db_path> <staging_dir> <data_dir>
