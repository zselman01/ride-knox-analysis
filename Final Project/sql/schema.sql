-- schema.sql -- the Ride Knox warehouse, Final Project edition.
-- One database, both years, every source file. Philosophy (carried over from
-- the SQL project and the fall warehouse, reconciled here in writing):
--   * REFUSE the impossible-to-identify: duplicate trip_ids (PRIMARY KEY)
--     and trips at stations that do not exist (foreign-key mirror in load.sql).
--   * STORE the implausible as delivered: missing timestamps, negative and
--     absurd durations survive the load; the reporting VIEW judges them.
--     The warehouse is the vendor's word; judging it is the analyst's job.
--   * The products lookup resolves Module 9's open question the lookup-table
--     way: the next product launch is one INSERT, not a schema rebuild.
--   * dock_history solves "the number moved": each year's capacity analysis
--     derives its own denominator instead of trusting the current directory.
